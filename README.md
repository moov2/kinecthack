# CSS Start

Kicking off a project and want some CSS? Look no further! Here is a handy starting point for getting your CSS on! At Moov2, Sass is our jam! This template uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) to construct the CSS file which is generated by running the [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) command. Not a fan or unfamiliar with Gulp? No worries, just take the CSS directory and copy it into your project and handle the compilation yourself.

## Getting Started

Easy! Copy the CSS directory into where you'd like the CSS to be in your project. You can also take the `gulpfile.js` file to if you want to use gulp and haven't got it setup yet (although remember to add the development dependencies to your `package.json` file.

Once you've got the CSS files into your project, we recommend checking out the `css/_vars.scss` partial and update any configuration values to suit your project.

## Contributing

Looking to adding some awesome CSS that you think would be beneficial to have at the start of the CSS process? Great! To get started with your contribution you will need to make sure you've got [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed in order to access the development dependencies. Fetching the development dependencies from [NPM](http://npmjs.org) can be down by running the code below.

    npm install

Now add your awesome CSS update and then run the command below to ensure that a `styles.css` is successfully created by the Sass compiler.

    gulp

You're done!
